# Networking-BruteForce

In the fourth instalment in my networking projects, I will be interacting with the web and using this to perform reconnaissance and use this information when brute-forcing a webpage. HTML parsing is a key part of creating both the brute-forcers and the recon tooling as by just examining login forms, we can easily identify what information is required to login and then target the relevant fields with the brute-forcer.
